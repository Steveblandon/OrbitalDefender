# OrbitalDefender
CONCEPT: the player controls a spaceship orbiting Earth. There are incoming waves of asteroids that the player must destroy otherwise they'll eventually destroy the planet or the spaceship itself.

Features:
  - shoot down asteroids
  - use a shield (energy field) to protect the spaceship from incoming asteroids
  - HUD with info for score, wave (level), energy usage, and to activate laser or shield
  - levels
  - score readouts at the end of every level and score upkeep

Contemplated Features:
  - achievements
  - upgrades to laser efficiency (in terms of energy usage), speed, strength
  - upgrades to spaceship rotational movement speed
  - upgrades to other spaceships
  - upgrades to more weapons on spaceships
  - upgrades to shield efficiency (in terms of energy usage), strength, and how long it lasts
  
TO-DO:
 - make laser and shield usage drain energy threshold
 - design levels
 - add sound and music
